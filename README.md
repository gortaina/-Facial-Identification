This repository was created for computer vision studies and the [DevPleno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV7mZc3D93Y&feature=emb_title) channel tutorial was used to implement a JavaScript code using the library [tracking.js](https://trackingjs.com/) for identifying faces in the video.

## Requirements
